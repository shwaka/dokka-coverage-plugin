A simple gradle plugin that computes the coverage of documentation generated by [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka).

## Usage
Add the following code to your `build.gradle.kts`.
```kotlin
plugins {
    // other plugins
    id("org.jetbrains.dokka") version "1.4.32"
    id("com.github.shwaka.dokkacov") version "0.1"
}
```

The task `dokkacovReport` prints coverage report to the console.

```bash
./gradlew dokkaHtml
./gradlew dokkacovReport
```

You can also generate a JSON file by the task `dokkacovWriteJson`, which can be used to generate a badge with [Shields.io](https://shields.io/). The JSON file will be written at `build/dokka/html/coverage.json` by default.

## Limitation
This plugin computes the coverage just by parsing HTML's generated by dokka.
So it may not work for different versions of dokka.
Moreover, since this plugin is tested for very few projects, the computation result may be wrong for other projects.

## Memo
`kotlinx.serialization` を使うと (plugin とそのユーザー両方の) `gradle` のバージョンに制約がついてしまうっぽい．
それは嫌なので jackson を使うことにした．
